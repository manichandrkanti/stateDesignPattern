## State Design Pattern implemented on Bread example
State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes. <br />
The main idea of State pattern is to allow the object for changing its behavior without changing its class.<br />
A Bread Machine behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at run-time depending on that state <br />
Operations have enter bread, remove bread and stay on StandBy mode these depend on the object's state. This state is usually represented by one or more enumerated constants.
